			Netsukuku


To download the netsukuku src code you have to checkout it from the cvs 
repository

# cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot login
or
# export CVSROOT=":pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot"
# cvs login

then check it out:

# cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot co netsukuku
or
# cvs -z3 co netsukuku
(providing the CVSROOT variable was set in the previous step)


Once you've checked out a copy of the source tree, you can update 
your source tree at any time so it is in sync with the latest and 
greatest by running the command:
# cvs -z3 update -d -P

A shorter way to get the code is by going to:
http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/files/


-

To compile the code you must have scons installed:
http://www.scons.org/

The code, for now, depends also on the libgmp. Generally you have it already
installed in your system, but eventually you can retrieve the libgmp here:
http://www.swox.com/gmp/

Then go in the src/ directory and type:
$ scons

The code will be compiled.
The binary built is "netsukuku_d".
