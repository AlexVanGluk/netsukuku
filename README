**
****  What is this?
**

Netsukuku is a pure net which exploits the chaos, it generates and sustains
itself autonomously, having the shape of a fractal.
The fusion of pure net with fractals and chaos is the characteristic which
allows to Netsukuku to be a diffused and distributed, not centralized,
anonymous, anarchical, not controlled and autonomous net.

In order to join to Netsukuku you have to use NetsukukuD, which is the daemon
implenting the Npv7 protocol.


**
****  Get the code!
**

(Skip this section if you downloaded the tarball) 

To download the netsukuku src code you have to checkout it from the cvs 
repository:

$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot login
or
$ export CVSROOT=":pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot"
$ cvs login

then check it out:

$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot co netsukuku
or
$ cvs -z3 co netsukuku
(providing the CVSROOT variable was set in the previous step)


Once you've checked out a copy of the source tree, you can update 
your source tree at any time so it is in sync with the latest and 
greatest by running the command:
# cvs -z3 update -d -P

A shorter way to get the code is by going to:
http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/files/


**
****  Build and install
**

To compile the code you must have scons installed:
http://www.scons.org/

The code depends also on the libgmp and openssl. Generally you have it already
installed on your system, but eventually you can retrieve the libgmp here:
http://www.swox.com/gmp/
and the openssl library here:
http://openssl.org

Then go in the src/ directory and type:
$ scons --help

That will show you all the options you can use in the build and installation
process. Finally execute:

$ scons 

The code will be compiled. If all went well install NetsukukuD with:

# scons install

Now you should give a look at /etc/netsukuku.conf (or wherever you installed
it) and modify it for your needs, but generally the default options are good.


**
****  How to use it
**

Before doing anything do:

$ man netsukuku_d

when you feel confortable and you are ready to dare type with root
priviledges:

# netsukuku_d

then just wait... ^_-

(For the first times it's cool to use the -D option to see what happens).

**
****  Bug report
**

{ Don't panic! }

If you encounter any bug, please report it to netsukuku@freaknet.org or
contacts any author explaining what the problem is and if possible a way to
reproduce it.


**
****  Hack the code
**

Feel free to debug, patch, modify and eat the code. Then submit your results
to the mailing list ^_-

There is a lot to code too! If you are a Kung Foo coder board, get on board and
help the development writing some nice poem. For a start you can take a look
at the src/TODO file.
