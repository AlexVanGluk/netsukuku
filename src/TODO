		[HIGH PRIORITY] 

- Strange anomalies added in the CVS version to verify: 
	- Quest ANDNA_CHECK_COUNTER to 134.103.184.72
	  * Cannot tcp_connect() to 163.114.222.44: No route to host
	  * Couldn't connect to 163.114.222.44 to launch the ANDNA_CHECK_COUNTER
	  * request
	
- DNS wrapper: ip -> hostnames
	- -r forward to other /etc/resolv.conf dns server

- The QSPN has to remove the died nodes after QSPN_WAIT*2 seconds.

- multi network interface support [76% completed]


		[MEDIUM PRIORITY] 

- Port the kernel route code for *BSD: take a look at rt_ioctl.c and
  rt_socket.c of quagga.
  
- API for the maps sync with the netsukuku_d daemon.

- Write the documentation for the code that can be used by other
  programs. (By the way it is already commented.)

- Anti spoof Hook: a node must not give the maps to a node, which is trying to
  use an ip of another gnode.


		[LOW PRIORITY]
		
- Ipv6 support by the DNS wrapper.

- Test request.c

- Optimize random_ip() to return valid IPs. A possible solution would be
	to zero all the invalid bits.
	
- Flush all the routes present in the routing table before starting the hook?

- root id check in "scons install"
