		[HIGH PRIORITY] 

- DNS wrapper: ip -> hostnames

- Aaah, do all the big endian/little endian stuff for the int and short in
  the packets.

- The QSPN has to remove the died nodes after QSPN_WAIT*2 seconds.

- Use the multipath to use more than one route to reach a node.


		[MEDIUM PRIORITY] 

- ANDNA Backup_gnodes. Really necessary?

- Anti spoof Hook: a node must not give the maps to a node, which is trying to
  use an ip of another gnode.

- Port the kernel route code for *BSD: take a look at rt_ioctl.c and
  rt_socket.c of quagga.
  
- API for the maps sync with the netsukuku_d daemon.

- Write the documentation for the code that can be used by other
  programs. (By the way it is already commented.)


		[LOW PRIORITY]

- Test request.c

- Optimize random_ip() to return valid IPs. A possible solution would be
	to zero all the invalid bits.
	
- Optimize the space of the free_node pkt: instead using an array of
  u_char for each free node, use just one bit and set it to one or zero.
  Use the nice functions of set_bit, clear_bit..., is_set, in asm/bitops.h.
	
- use the gnode_ttl for broadcast

- Flush all the routes present in the routing table before starting the hook?
