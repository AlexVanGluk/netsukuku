	- -r forward to other /etc/resolv.conf dns server

		[MEDIUM PRIORITY] 

- Port the kernel route code for *BSD: take a look at rt_ioctl.c and
  rt_socket.c of quagga.
  
- API for the maps sync with the netsukuku_d daemon.

- Write the documentation for the code that can be used by other
  programs. (By the way it is already commented.)

- Anti spoof Hook: a node must not give the maps to a node, which is trying to
  use an ip of another gnode.


		[LOW PRIORITY]
		
- Ipv6 support by the DNS wrapper.

- Test request.c

- Optimize random_ip() to return valid IPs. A possible solution would be
	to zero all the invalid bits.
	
- Flush all the routes present in the routing table before starting the hook?

- root id check in "scons install"
