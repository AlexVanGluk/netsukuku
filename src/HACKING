Use cscope! 
(Or better cscope+vim)

If you see a word surrounded by semicolon, jump on it. 
Example:
	 ...
	 *
	 * This structure is used in :map_node:.
	 *
	 ...

The word `self', when used in a comment placed inside a structure
definition, refers to the same structure. Ex:

	struct foo
	{
		/*
		 * self.baz is a friend of self.bar
		 */

		int bar;
		int baz;
	}

Suppose we have a nested structure definition, then we'll use the ^^ symbol to
refer to the top structure. Ex:

	struct map 
	{
		struct node
		{
			/*
			 * Coordinates relative to this ^^map
			 */
			int xyz;
		}
	}

The ^^ symbol can be also used to indicate the upper structures. Ex:

	struct map 
	{
		struct group
		{
			/*
			 * Distance from the start of the  self^^map  map
			 */
			int group_distance;

			struct node
			{
				/*
				 * Distance from the start of the
				 * self^^group^^map  map
				 */
				/*
				 * Distance from the start of the ^^map
				 */
				int node_distance;
			}
		}
	}
