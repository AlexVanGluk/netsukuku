=head1 NAME

netsukuku.conf - Netsukuku daemon configuration file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

/etc/netsukuku/netsukuku.conf

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ntkd(8) loads its options from the command line and from B<netsukuku.conf>.
The options that are changed infrequently resides in the configuration file.
The B<netsukuku.conf> file is typically installed at /etc/netsukuku/netsukuku.conf.

The comments starts with a '#'.
If an option is commented, B<ntkd> will use its default value.

The character '=' is used to assign a value to an option.

All the options will be overridden by their command line equivalent.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 RESTRICTED MODE

=over

=item B<ntk_restricted_mode> = I<bool>

When set to 1, NetsukukuD will be started in restricted mode to be compatible
with Internet. In the restricted mode, only IPs of the largest private subnet,
i.e. 10.x.x.x are chosen.

=back

=item B<ntk_restricted_class> = I<bool>

When set to 1 the IPs will be chosen from the 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 range
(use this option only if you can't use the 10.x.x.x class).

### Internet connection
#


 * * If you have an Internet connection please fill this options. * *

 We are assuming that you are running in restricted mode since you want to
 be both in Netsukuku and Internet. So, if you have an internet connection
 set `internet_connection' to 1.

 Set the `internet_gateway' option to the IP of the gateway you use to reach 
 the Internet and specify the network interface too, for example:
 "internet_gateway = 192.168.1.1:eth0". This option is necessary only if you
 don't have the default route set when you run NetsukukuD (i.e. you haven't
 connected yet), otherwise, leave it commented.

 You have also to set your upload and download bandwidth in 
 `internet_upload_rate' and `internet_download_rate'. It is expressed in Kb/s,
 so if you have a line which maximum can do: 640 Kb/s in dwload and 30 Kb/s in 
 upload, set them to 640 and 30.

 `internet_ping_hosts' is a list of Internet hosts which will be pinged to
 verify if the connection is alive, you can use the default hosts.

 If you want to share your Internet connection among other Netsukuku nodes, 
 set `share_internet' to 1.

 Set `shape_internet' to 1 if you want to shape your outgoing
 Internet traffic.

 `use_shared_internet' specifies if you want to use the Internet connections
 shared by the Netsukuku nodes. Set it to 0, if you want to rely only on your
 connection (if any).
 
internet_connection	= 1
internet_gateway	= 192.168.1.1:eth0
internet_download_rate  = 640
internet_upload_rate	= 30
internet_ping_hosts	= google.com:cisco.com:sourceforge.net:dyne.org
share_internet		= 1
shape_internet		= 1
use_shared_internet	= 1


#
### ANDNA
#


 To disable the start of the ANDNA daemon at the launch of ntkd, set
 this option to 1. Note that when the ANDNA daemon is disabled, the andna
 system will not work at all, so it will be impossible to resolve, register
 or update hostnames.

disable_andna		= 0


 When NetsukukuD starts it modifies /etc/resolv.conf writing in the first
 line "nameserver 127.0.0.1". The old /etc/resolv.conf is copied in
 /etc/resolv.conf.bak. When the daemon is closed /etc/resolv.conf is
 restored. If you want to disable this set disable_resolvconf to 1.
 If it is disabled you won't be able to resolve hostnames!

disable_resolvconf	= 0


#
### Limits
#


 How many connection the netsukuku daemons can simultaneusly handle.

ntk_max_connections		= 512

 How many simultaneusly connections to the daemons from a single host are
 allowed.
ntk_max_accepts_per_host	= 16

 The wait time necessary for a host to reconnect to the daemons after all the
 ntk_max_accepts_per_host were used.

max_accepts_per_host_time	= 4	#in seconds


#
### Files

 ntkd will save its process id in this file

pid_file 		= /var/run/ntkd.pid
