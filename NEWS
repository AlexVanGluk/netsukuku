0.0.4b

- The multi-interface support was added, now it is possible to use multiple
  network interfaces without the need of the bridge, just specify each
  interface you want to use with the -i option. (man netsukuku_d).

- The multipath support has been enabled for the external map, this means that
  more than one route will be used to reach a gnode. In other words the load
  balacing has been fully enabled.

- Endianness fixes: now the packets can be sent between two machines with
  different endianness.
  
- All the the packets are now sent without any alignment.

- The free_nodes struct has been optimised: to keep the list of free nodes it
  uses single bits instead of single bytes, this means that the list is now of
  32 bytes instead of 256.

- The bug in the load_rh_cache code is now fixed. (It caused crashes when the
  daemon was closed)
  
- The Make/configure support was added. Now you can use both SCons os Make to
  compile and install Netsukuku.

- The installation path of the man page is now fixed.

- The /usr/share/netsukuku directory is now created during the installation

- Now /sys/net/ipv4/conf/INTERFACE/rp_filter is automatically disabled for the
  used interface.

  '\n').
